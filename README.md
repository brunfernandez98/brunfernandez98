My name is Jorge Bruno Fernández, but I go by my first name, Jorge. Born in 1998 🍷, I dive into programming as both a passion and a hobby. I enjoy coding, listening to music, and playing basketball in my free time.

I began my programming journey at the age of 13, delving into HTML, CSS, JAVA, VB.NET, and SQL. Currently, I lean towards Typescript or any language that gets the job done. I have a fondness for the shell, whether it's Windows PowerShell, BASH, or ZSH.

Currently, I'm immersed in developing CRUD panels using the React JS library, along with harnessing the power of NEXT JS for server-side rendering and static site generation. I specialize in utilizing Google Cloud and Firebase as serverless services to create robust and scalable applications.

Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at UNIVERSIDAD ORT.
